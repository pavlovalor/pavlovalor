### 🚀 About Me  

I’ve been building for the web since the days of table layouts and “under-construction” GIFs. What started as tinkering with silicon boards as a kid grew into a career spanning engineering, product development, and tech leadership.  

My journey has taken me from writing my first production code at 18, to serving as a captain in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and then back into tech—leading engineering teams, mentoring future developers, and driving innovation across startups and enterprises alike.

### 🔧 What I Do  

- **Engineering Leadership** – from CTO at a startup to Head of Competency at Beetroot, I’ve scaled teams, set technical direction, and built developer communities.  
- **Product Development** – I thrive at the intersection of code and business, turning ideas into scalable, high-quality solutions.  
- **Mentorship & Education** – I’ve taught and mentored hundreds of students at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and Shevchenko National University, creating a “zero-to-hero” course for aspiring front-end developers.  
- **Hands-on Engineering** – I still love shipping code: React/Redux, Node.js, Postgres, Docker, and beyond.
